The dashboard provides an interactive view of trends, claim ratios, and financial outcomes to support data-driven decision-making.
## Objectives

2.	Evaluate premium income and claim payouts to assess profitability.
3.	Monitor claim performance by policy type and claim status.
4.	Track claim duration and efficiency to identify operational bottlenecks.
5.	Measure overall business performance through key financial indicators.
## Key Insights
1.	Life and Travel policies generated the highest premiums but also recorded the highest claim payouts.
2.	The company experienced a negative profit margin (-₦10.93M) due to claims exceeding collected premiums.
3.	Claim ratios are highest for Auto and Life policies, indicating potential risk concentration.
4.	36–55 age groups are the most active and profitable customer segments.
